This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
# or
docker compose up
```

This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile and starts the container on port 3000.

```bash
docker-compose down
# or
docker compose down
```

This command stops the container and removes it along with the default network configurations (the built image will remain intact).

If you also want to remove the built image, run:

```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all
# or
docker compose down --rmi all
```
